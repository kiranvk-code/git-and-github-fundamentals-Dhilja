learned about the basic terminologies of git like :

repositories: where all the files of the project includes

branch: we can create new branch which seperate line of development which  doesnt affect the main  branch.

commit: snapshot of a repo at a particular point of development

push : "push" your commits to a remote repository (such as one hosted on GitHub) to share your work with others or to back up your changes

pull :  to update your local repository with changes that have been made to the remote repository.

merge : to merge the branches to the main branch.
